Project I did for the Security of Malicious Operating Systems laboratory, which identifies spam emails using TensorFlow. It also supports Base64 encoding and has a precision of about 98%.

During the teacher's evalution, the code I wrote didn't get any penalty for execution time, meaning it is well-optimised.
